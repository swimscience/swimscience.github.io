            <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
            <p>SwimScience believes in honest, transparent communication with our readers. This page explains our affiliate relationships and how we may earn income when you use our recommendations.</p>

            <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
            <p>Affiliate links are special tracking URLs that allow us to earn a commission when you purchase products through our links. <strong>You pay the same price</strong> whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the retailer. The commission comes from the retailer's marketing budget, not from your purchase price.</p>

            <h2>Our Affiliate Partnerships</h2>

            <h3>Amazon Associates Program</h3>
            <p>SwimScience is a participant in the Amazon Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and Amazon.es.</p>

            <p><strong>Official Amazon Disclosure:</strong> "As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases."</p>

            <p>When you click an Amazon link on our site and make a purchase, we may receive a small commission (typically 1-4% of the purchase price). This helps support our free swimming calculators and educational content.</p>

            <h3>Other Potential Affiliates</h3>
            <p>We may participate in other affiliate programs for swimming-related products and services, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ShareASale (Speedo, TYR, SwimOutlet)</li>
                <li>Impact Radius (swimming apps and services)</li>
                <li>Other swimming equipment and training programs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Product Recommendation Philosophy</h2>

            <h3>We Only Recommend What We Believe In</h3>
            <p>All product recommendations on SwimScience are based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal experience:</strong> Products we have used in training</li>
                <li><strong>Research:</strong> Reviews, specifications, and swimmer feedback</li>
                <li><strong>Value:</strong> Products that offer genuine benefit to swimmers</li>
                <li><strong>Price consideration:</strong> Fair pricing for the quality provided</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Editorial Independence</h3>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> The presence of an affiliate relationship does not influence our editorial content or product recommendations. We maintain complete editorial independence.</p>

            <p>We would recommend the same products whether or not we had an affiliate relationship. The affiliate commission simply helps us keep SwimScience free and ad-free.</p>

            <h2>When You Should Use Our Links</h2>
            <p>If you find our calculators or content valuable and plan to purchase swimming equipment anyway, using our affiliate links is an easy way to support our work at no extra cost to you.</p>

            <h2>When You Shouldn't Feel Obligated</h2>
            <p>You are never obligated to use our affiliate links. If you prefer to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shop directly at retailers</li>
                <li>Compare prices at multiple stores</li>
                <li>Use your existing retailer relationships</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's completely fine! Our content and calculators are free regardless of whether you use affiliate links.</p>
