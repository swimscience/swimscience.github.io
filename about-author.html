                <p class="text-lg mb-0"><strong>Competitive Swimmer | Software Developer | SwimAnalytics Founder</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Swimming Background</h2>
            <p>I've been swimming competitively for over 15 years, specializing in middle-distance freestyle events (200m-800m). My swimming journey has taken me from local club competitions to national-level events, where I've experienced firsthand the challenges and rewards of competitive swimming.</p>

            <p>Throughout my swimming career, I've learned that success in the pool comes not just from hard work, but from smart training. Understanding pacing, efficiency metrics like SWOLF, and training zones transformed my approach to swimming and led to significant performance improvements.</p>

            <h2>Why I Created SwimScience</h2>
            <p>SwimScience was born from a simple frustration: most swimming calculators online were either too basic, buried in ads, or required sign-ups to use. I wanted to create free, powerful tools that any swimmer could access instantly.</p>

            <p>The calculators on this site are tools I wish I'd had when I was training seriously. They're based on proven swimming science and designed to help swimmers at all levels—from beginners learning to calculate pace to competitive athletes optimizing training zones.</p>

            <h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
            <p>As a software developer, I combine my swimming knowledge with technical skills to create tools that are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accurate:</strong> Built on established swimming formulas (CSS, SWOLF, pace calculations)</li>
                <li><strong>Fast:</strong> All calculations happen instantly in your browser</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy-focused:</strong> Your swimming data stays on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Free:</strong> No paywalls, no required sign-ups</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SwimAnalytics - The Next Step</h2>
            <p>While SwimScience provides essential calculators, I wanted to build something more comprehensive for serious swimmers. That's why I created <a href="https://swimanalytics.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwimAnalytics</a>, a complete training analytics platform that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatically imports swim data from your watch</li>
                <li>Tracks progress across all metrics (pace, SWOLF, CSS)</li>
                <li>Provides AI-powered training insights</li>
                <li>Creates personalized training plans</li>
            </ul>

            <p>SwimAnalytics takes the concepts from these calculators and applies them to your entire training history, giving you the big picture of your swimming development.</p>

            <h2>Coaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe swimming training should be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data-informed but not data-obsessed:</strong> Numbers guide training but feel and technique matter most</li>
                <li><strong>Individualized:</strong> What works for Olympic swimmers may not work for age-groupers or masters swimmers</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable:</strong> Long-term improvement beats short-term heroics</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoyable:</strong> Swimming should be challenging but rewarding</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Credentials</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>15+ years competitive swimming experience</li>
                <li>National-level competition participant</li>
                <li>Middle-distance freestyle specialist (200m-800m)</li>
                <li>Software developer with expertise in sports analytics</li>
                <li>Founder of SwimAnalytics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Content Approach</h2>
            <p>All content on SwimScience is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Based on experience:</strong> I've used these techniques in training</li>
                <li><strong>Scientifically grounded:</strong> Concepts come from established swimming science</li>
                <li><strong>Practical:</strong> Focused on what actually works in the pool</li>
                <li><strong>Honest:</strong> I share what's worked for me and acknowledge what hasn't</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Trust These Calculators?</h2>
            <p>These aren't random formulas from the internet. Each calculator uses proven methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pace Calculator:</strong> Standard time/distance conversion used by coaches worldwide</li>
                <li><strong>SWOLF Calculator:</strong> Originally developed by Total Immersion Swimming, validated by research</li>
                <li><strong>CSS Calculator:</strong> Based on Wakayoshi's Critical Swim Speed research (1992)</li>
                <li><strong>Split Calculator:</strong> Applied pacing strategies from competitive swimming</li>
            </ul>
